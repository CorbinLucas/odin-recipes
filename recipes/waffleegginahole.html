        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <li>Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup or glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter). Move waffle to a square of parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the preheated air fryer, along with the small center waffle. </li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <li>Crack egg directly into the center of waffle hole; season with salt and pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook until the white of the egg has started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <li>Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese onto egg waffle, and cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <li>Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
