            <!--Changed header size from h5 to h3 to make the headings larger-->
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until evenly browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight.</li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
            <h3>Step 9</h3>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
